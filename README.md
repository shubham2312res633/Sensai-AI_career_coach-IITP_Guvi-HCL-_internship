## üé® Design & Architecture

The application follows a modern, full-stack approach with Next.js serving both the frontend and the backend API.

  * **Frontend:** The user interface is built with React 19 components, styled with Tailwind CSS, and utilizes Shadcn UI for a professional look. Next.js handles routing and server-side rendering for optimal performance.
  * **Backend:** Next.js API routes act as the backend. Prisma connects to the NeonDB PostgreSQL database to manage user data, profiles, and other application state. Clerk handles all authentication flows, and Inngest is used to process long-running AI tasks in the background, ensuring the application remains responsive.
